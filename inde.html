 <h2>The meaning of feathers</h2>

     <p>
    Down below is one of the most sacred items in the Native american culture;fethers. The feathers are either from a Hawk or an Eagle. Feathers are used during ceremonies by an elder. Dropping a feather is a bad thing to do because it is always supposed to stay up in the air fanning something becasue that's what a bird did. The bird is still living in the feather so we always have to treat it with respect.
